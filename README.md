# Bookstore Database Management System

The Bookstore Database Management System is a project created to help learners understand how to manage and structure databases for real-world applications. The system simulates how a bookstore manages books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping.

This project gives learners practical experience in designing and working with relational databases using MySQL.

## Objective

This project helps learners understand and apply key database concepts, including:

- Creating and organizing tables for bookstore data.
- Defining relationships between tables (e.g., books and authors, customers and orders).
- Normalizing data to remove redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve, update, and manage data.

By completing this project, learners will strengthen their skills in database design and SQL, which are essential for software development and data management roles.
